# About Me - Karli Nadsady

I am a 3rd year student at Ohio University studying for my B.S. in Electrical Engineering on the Computer Engineering track with a minor in Computer Science. I am currently studying abroad at University of Galway in Ireland.

I have been interested in programming since I was young. My first experience programming was a guided class on modding Minecraft in Java when I was 11. Since then, the majority of my programming experience is in C++ at Ohio University. I also have experience in Python and C#.

My most recent programming education experience is in Unity using C#. I am taking a Games Programming class at the University of Galway, where my final project will be to design my own 3D video game. I am incredibly excited for this project and can't wait to share it once it's done!

My portfolio is still growing, but most of my highlights can be found at my GitHub list [here](https://github.com/stars/kn274621/lists/ou-c-project-portfolio).

Featured is a group project and a final project from my CS2401 (C++) class. The [group project](https://github.com/kn274621/CS2401-FinalProject) was my first experience with Git branches, as well as inheritance. It is a shopping application where you pick from various clothing items in a department store and add them to a shopping list. The [final project](https://github.com/kn274621/CS2401-FinalProject) was a game, Boop. We had to design a board and user interface to play this game, as well as assign point values to a given "AI" opponent to make them "intelligent."
