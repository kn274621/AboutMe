# About Me - Karli Nadsady

I am a 3rd year student at Ohio University studying for my B.S. in Electrical Engineering on the Computer Engineering track with a minor in Computer Science. I am currently studying abroad at University of Galway in Ireland.

I have been interested in programming since I was young. My first experience programming was a guided class on modding Minecraft in Java when I was 11. Since then, the majority of my programming experience is in C++ at Ohio University. I also have experience in Python and C#.

My most recent programming education experience is in Unity using C#. I am taking a Games Programming class at the University of Galway, where my final project will be to design my own 3D video game. I am incredibly excited for this project and can't wait to share it once it's done!
